# Task Manager

A simple task manager application built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**. It allows users to **add**, **delete**, and **mark tasks as complete**. The app uses **LocalStorage** to persist data across page refreshes.

## Features
- **Add tasks**: Create new tasks by typing in the input field.
- **Complete tasks**: Mark tasks as completed by clicking on the task name.
- **Delete tasks**: Remove tasks by clicking the cross (‚ùå).
- **Filter tasks**: View all tasks, only completed tasks, or only pending tasks.
- **Persistent data**: Tasks are saved in **LocalStorage**, so they persist even after refreshing the page.
- **Mobile-friendly design**: The app is responsive and works well on mobile devices.
